# pi-glasswing

> Parallel AI agent harness for web vulnerability discovery. Architecture adapted from Cloudflare's [Project Glasswing](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cyber-frontier-models/).

**pi-glasswing** orchestrates parallel [pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-coding-agent) sessions to discover web application vulnerabilities. Each session is a fresh agent with full context window dedicated to one attack pattern — avoiding the context compaction problem where a single agent covering 44 patterns forgets earlier findings by pattern #30.

## Pipeline

```
Intel Harvest (live CVE data from free APIs)
  ↓
Recon (architecture doc + live context injected)
  ↓
Hunt (~44 parallel agents, one per attack pattern)
  ↓
Gapfill (re-queues empty patterns with narrowed scope from recon clues)
  ↓
Validate (adversarial second agent — can only disprove)
  ↓
Dedupe (root cause collapse, variant analysis)
  ↓
Report (JSON + Markdown)
```

| Stage | Model | Thinking | What it does |
|-------|-------|----------|--------------|
| **Intel** | N/A (API queries) | — | Harvests live vulnerabilities from OSV, GitHub Advisories, CISA KEV, NVD, npm audit, Scorecard |
| **Recon** | DeepSeek V4 Flash | medium | Single pi session maps trust boundaries, entry points, data flows, auth |
| **Hunt** | DeepSeek V4 Flash | low | 44 parallel pi sessions, each scoped to one attack pattern |
| **Gapfill** | DeepSeek V4 Flash | low | Second pass for patterns that found nothing — uses recon doc clues |
| **Validate** | DeepSeek V4 Pro | high | Adversarial — can only disprove findings, not propose new ones |
| **Dedupe** | Python | — | Same root cause + location → single record with variants |
| **Report** | Python | — | Structured JSON + human-readable Markdown |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Full pipeline
python3 harness.py /path/to/target-repo

# Step-by-step: recon only
python3 harness.py /path/to/target-repo --recon-only

# Specific patterns
python3 harness.py /path/to/target-repo --patterns sql-injection,missing-auth

# Intel harvester standalone
python3 vulnerability_context.py /path/to/target-repo
```

### Requirements

- **pi** (≥0.74) — the coding agent CLI. [Install](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-coding-agent)
- **Python** ≥3.10 with `requests`
- **web-vuln-audit skill** — 44 attack patterns at `~/.pi/agent/skills/web-vuln-audit/`
- **WooYun knowledge base** (optional) — 86MB of real-world bypass techniques at `~/projects/pi-glasswing/wooyun-categories/`. Download from [scottyha/wooyun-legacy](https://github.com/tanweai/wooyun-legacy) or skip — the harness degrades gracefully.

## Live Intel Sources

All free, no signup required:

| Source | What it provides |
|--------|-----------------|
| **OSV** | All known CVEs for your exact dependencies (30+ ecosystems) |
| **GitHub Advisory API** | Fresh advisories modified in last 24h |
| **CISA KEV** | Actively exploited CVEs — the urgency filter |
| **NVD** | Fresh CVEs published in last 24h |
| **npm Audit** | Registry-level npm vulnerability lookup |
| **OpenSSF Scorecard** | Project security posture (public repos only) |
| **OpenSSF Malicious Packages** | Confirmed malicious package records (MAL-* IDs via OSV) |

## CLI Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--batch-size N` | Concurrent pi sessions per batch (default: 8) |
| `--patterns x,y,z` | Comma-separated pattern IDs to run (default: all 44) |
| `--skip-recon` | Skip recon (requires `--recon-file`) |
| `--recon-file PATH` | Use existing recon doc |
| `--hunt-only` | Stop after hunt (skip validate/dedupe/report) |
| `--recon-only` | Run only recon and save architecture doc |
| `--skip-intel` | Skip live vulnerability intel harvesting |
| `--intel-file PATH` | Use existing intel brief (skip harvest) |
| `--intel-hours N` | Lookback for fresh advisories (default: 24h) |
| `--no-gapfill` | Skip gapfill re-queue pass |
| `--list-patterns` | List all attack patterns and exit |

## Implicit Contracts

| Contract | Details |
|----------|---------|
| `PATTERNS` dict ↔ skill markdown | Pattern `"name"` values must match `### Pattern: Name` headings in skill files |
| Gapfill keyword mapping | New patterns added to PATTERNS must also be added to `_map_recon_to_patterns()` in gapfill, or they'll never be re-queued |
| Recon doc section #8 | Gapfill expects a "Notable Security-Relevant Findings" section in recon output. The RECON_PROMPT explicitly requests this |
| JSONL parsing | pi `--mode json` output must contain `agent_end` events with assistant messages. If pi's JSONL format changes, findings silently become empty |
| Scorecard for private repos | OpenSSF Scorecard API only covers public GitHub repos. Private repos silently return empty — this is expected |
| WooYun directory | Optional. Missing files are silently skipped |

## Architecture Notes

### Why parallel narrow agents over one exhaustive agent

From Cloudflare's Project Glasswing research: a single agent covering 44 patterns covers ~0.1% of a codebase's attack surface before context compaction discards earlier findings. 44 agents with one job each beat 1 agent with 44 jobs.

### Why adversarial validation

The same agent that finds a vulnerability will rationalize confirming it. A separate validator with a different prompt and more capable model that can only *disprove* catches false positives that self-review misses.

### Why gapfill

Agents drift toward attack classes they've already found success in. A hunter that finds a SQL injection will keep going deeper on that file, never reaching the `.env` file for credentials. Gapfill checks the recon doc for flagged areas that patterns missed and re-queues them with narrowed scope.
